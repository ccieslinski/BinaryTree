# BinaryTree
BinaryTree app creates a binary tree with a given number of nodes. Class BinaryTree contains several methods that work with a Binary Tree object. Comments just next to each method describe what given method does. In class main I implemented scanner class so after running the programm each method is being presented. Not all the code is mine, however I've put proper disclaimers about where did I get the code from.
